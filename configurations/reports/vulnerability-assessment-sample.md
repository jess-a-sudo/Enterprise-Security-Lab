# Sample Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Executive Summary
During the CySA lab implementation, a comprehensive vulnerability assessment was conducted revealing critical security findings. This report demonstrates professional reporting capabilities developed through academic practice.

## Methodology
- **Tools Used**: Nessus Professional, Nmap, Manual Testing
- **Scope**: Windows Server 2016, Network Infrastructure
- **Duration**: 4-hour assessment window
- **Standards**: OWASP Testing Guide, NIST SP 800-115

## Critical Findings
### 1. Weak SSH Configuration
**Risk**: High
**Affected System**: Network Devices
**Description**: Default SSH settings allow brute-force attempts
**Evidence**: See `/evidence/screenshots/ssh-testing.png`
**Remediation**: Implement key-based authentication, rate limiting

### 2. Unnecessary Services
**Risk**: Medium
**Affected System**: Windows Server 2016
**Description**: Non-essential services increase attack surface
**Evidence**: Nmap scan results show multiple open ports
**Remediation**: Disable unused services following CIS benchmarks

## Student Learning Reflection
**Academic Context**: Learned vulnerability assessment theory in security courses
**Professional Application**: Practiced industry-standard reporting format
**Skill Development**: Improved technical writing and risk communication
**Next Steps**: Practice executive summary writing for non-technical audiences
